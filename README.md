# Reconciliator

This Project Reconciliator is based on the accounting for matching the ledger book data from various softwares out of a file and
finding the difference with respect to the corresponding amount added in the second voucher. It provides all the data in a .txt file.

This data can be directly copied and pasted in the excel sheet and can be used further for account book holding.


Note: This program is simple and still under development. It does not have a GUI but a command line interface.


You have to enter the list of first voucher numbers and then their corresponding amounts and then the second voucher numbers and then their amount. After that you will find the .txt file in the directory of the program itself.
